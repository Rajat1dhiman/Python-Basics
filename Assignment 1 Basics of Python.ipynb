What is Python and why it is popular?\n","\n","Ans. Python is a high level , interpretd programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guidu Van Rossum and released in 1991.\n","Python is populr for various reasons\n","1. Ease of learning: Python 's sybtax is clear and concise making  it  is accesible for beginners.\n","2. Vesatility: Python is ysed for web development, data analysis , Artificial intelligence , scientific computing and more.\n","3. Runs on Various Platforms: Python run on various Operating systems including Windows, Linux ,MacOS etc.\n","4.

What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans.The Python Interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code.\n","When you write a Python Program , you typically save it with .py extension and the interpreter takes the file and converts it into machine readable instructions that the computer can undersatnd and execute.\n","Types of Python Interpreter:\n","1. CPython\n","2. JPython etc.\n","\n","Key Points of Interpreter:\n","1. Interactive Mode:  You can enter python commands on at time, and the interpreter will execute them immediately and it is useful for testing and debugging.\n","2.
